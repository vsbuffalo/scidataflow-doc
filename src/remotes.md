# Working with Remotes

SciDataFlow is designed to work with commonly-used scientific data
repositories such as [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org) and
[FigShare](https://figshare.com/). The `sdf` tool can upload and
retrieve data from these remote services, saving researchers' time
when submitting supplementary data to these scientific data
repositories.
