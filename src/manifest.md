# The Data Manifest Format

The Data Manifest (`data_manifest.yml`) is a simple, human readable
YAML format. Each Data Manifest acts as a sort of recipe on how to
retrieve data and place it in the proper subdirectories of your
project. The Data Manifest is not designed to be edited by the user;
rather, the `sdf` tool will modify it through its various
subcommands.
