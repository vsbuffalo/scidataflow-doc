# Creating API Tokens

To use remote data repositories, you'll first need to create a
personal authentication token. Below are the instructions on how to
do this for each supported remote repository:

 - [Generating a new FigShare Personal Token](https://help.figshare.com/article/how-to-get-a-personal-token)
 - [Generating a new Zenodo Personal Token](https://developers.zenodo.org/#creating-a-personal-access-token)

With the tokens created, you can now link a project subdirectory to a
remote repository using [sdf link]().
